Bipolar Assignment - CI/CD Pipeline for Selenium-Driven Web Application

Ready to explore the magic behind our web application? This project isn't just code; it's a journey through automation using Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Prometheus, and Grafana. Let's make tech feel like a friendly tour guide!

Inside Our Toolbox 🧰
Where the Code Lives 🏡
The source code of our web application hangs out in the src/ directory. It's like the heart of our project!
Jenkinsfile: The Project Guidebook 📜
The Jenkinsfile is our guide, showing us the path through building, testing, deploying, and keeping an eye on things.
Dockerfile: The App’s Suitcase 🧳
Think of the Dockerfile as the suitcase for our web app. It packs everything needed for its adventures.
Ansible Directory (Optional): The Deployment Crew 🛠️
The ansible/ directory holds the crew's playbook (ansible/deploy.yml) for deploying our app. It's like our app’s travel planner!
Monitoring Configuration (Optional): The Health Trackers 🌡️
In prometheus-config/ and grafana-config/, we set up trackers to keep an eye on our app’s health. Safety first!
Documentation: Your Map 🗺️
This very document, the README.md, is like a map. It tells you where to go, what to do, and a bit of the story.
Our CI/CD Adventure 🚀

Step 1 - Checking Out 🕵️
We start by checking out the source code from our trusty GitHub repository.

Step 2 - Packaging the App 📦
We build and package our web app using Maven. It's like wrapping a gift for our users!

Step 3 - Reports Time 📊
HTML reports tell us how well our app is doing. Think of it as a progress report for our digital hero!

Step 4 - Docker Creates Magic 🪄
Docker does its magic, turning our app into a special package ready to travel.

Step 5 - Docker Login 👤
We log in to Docker Hub, the airport for our app, before it takes off.

Step 6 - Pushing to DockerHub 🚢
Our app sets sail into the digital sea by pushing its Docker image to Docker Hub.

Step 7 - Ansible Deployment (Optional) 🚀
Ansible steps in to deploy our app, making sure it arrives safely at its destination.

Step 8 - Monitoring Setup (Optional) 📡
We set up basic monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, like putting health trackers on our app.

## Stages Explanation

### 1. **CheckOut**
   - **Description:** This stage checks out the source code from the GitHub repository.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     git 'git clone https://github.com/kranthi619/Bipolar-assignment.git'
     
     ```

### 2. **Package the Application**
   - **Description:** This stage builds and packages the web application using Maven.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     sh 'mvn clean package'
     ```

### 3. **Publish Reports using HTML**
   - **Description:** This stage publishes HTML reports generated by the test suite.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     publishHTML([allowMissing: false, alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false, keepAll: false, reportDir: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Bipolar-assignment/target/surefire-reports', reportFiles: 'index.html', reportName: 'HTML Report', reportTitles: '', useWrapperFileDirectly: true])
     ```

### 4. **Docker Image Creation**
   - **Description:** This stage creates a Docker image for the web application.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     sh 'docker build -t kranthi619/insurence-project:latest .'
     ```

### 5. **Docker Login**
   - **Description:** This stage logs into Docker Hub for pushing the Docker image.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'Docker-Hub', passwordVariable: 'dockerHubPassword', usernameVariable: 'dockerHubUser')]) {
       sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerHubUser} -p ${env.dockerHubPassword}"
     }
     ```

### 6. **Push Image to DockerHub**
   - **Description:** This stage pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     sh 'docker push kranthi619/insurence-project:latest'
     ```

### 7. **Deploy Application Ansible**
   - **Description:** This stage deploys the application using Ansible.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     ansiblePlaybook credentialsId: 'privatekey', disableHostKeyChecking: true, installation: 'ansible', inventory: '/etc/ansible/hosts', playbook: 'deploy.yml'
     ```

### 8. **Setup Monitoring**
   - **Description:** This stage sets up basic monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
   - **Action:**
     ```groovy
     // Install Prometheus
     sh 'docker run -d -p 9090:9090 --name prometheus prom/prometheus'

     // Install Grafana
     sh 'docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana grafana/grafana'

     // Additional configuration or setup steps if needed

     // Output monitoring URLs
     echo 'Prometheus is running at http://localhost:9090'
     echo 'Grafana is running at http://localhost:3000'
     ```
I wanted to express my gratitude for the opportunity to interview with Bipolar. It was a pleasure discussing the role and learning more about the team. I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to Bipolar's success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
